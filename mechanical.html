    <h4>Mechanical Engineering Department Overview:</h4>
    <br>
    <p>
        The Mechanical Engineering Department commenced its educational journey in 1998, establishing an undergraduate
        (UG) program with an initial intake of 40 students. In response to growing demand, the UG intake increased to 60
        students in 1999, marking an early phase of expansion and popularity.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Program Expansion and Accreditations:</h4>
    <br>
    <p>Experiencing significant growth in 2003, the department further increased its UG intake to 120, demonstrating a
        commitment to meeting the rising demand for mechanical engineering education. In 2008, the department
        diversified its academic offerings by introducing a Postgraduate program (PG) in Design Engineering with intake
        of 18 students and establishing a Ph.D. Research Centre. In 2009, the UG program received accreditation from the
        National Board of Accreditation (NBA), attesting to the department’s commitment to maintaining high-quality
        education standards.

    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Infrastructure and Research Facilities:</h4>
    <br>
    <p>The year 2010 saw the establishment of an Advanced Manufacturing Lab, providing students with practical learning
        opportunities and enhancing the department’s research capabilities. In 2011, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)
        was signed with BARC, Mumbai, fostering collaboration and strengthening ties with a renowned research
        institution. A Microfabrication Lab was developed in 2016, showcasing the department’s dedication to staying at
        the forefront of technological advancements in the field. Renewed accreditation for the UG program from the NBA
        in 2017 reaffirmed the department’s commitment to delivering a high-quality education.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Research and Innovation Milestones:</h4>
    <br>
   
    <p>A significant boost in research and development occurred in 2018 with the receipt of a 27 Lakhs fund from BRNS,
        Mumbai, contributing to the department’s innovative initiatives. Continuous quality recognition characterized in
        2020 with extension of NBA accreditation. The 9 patents had filed by the faulty members among which 2 patents
        had been granted showcasing the department’s commitment to innovation. In 2021, the department secured research
        funds under the MODROB scheme and from ASHRAE. The department’s contribution is noteworthy in achievement of
        NAAC A+ Accreditation for the institute with an impressive CGPA of 3.46/4.00.

    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Recent Grants and Projects:</h4>
    <br>
    <p>The department’s initiative has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to promoting a vibrant research culture
        among students, showcasing remarkable achievements in various domains. A testament to this commitment is the
        publication of 106 papers in esteemed National and International Journals and Conferences by our dedicated
        students. Furthermore, the initiative has fostered an environment of innovation, resulting in 38 students
        receiving awards for their outstanding contributions in project competitions, publications, and other academic
        endeavours. Impressively, students have showcased their practical skills by developing 12 innovative products.
        Additionally, the initiative takes pride in the fact that students have filed one patent, further solidifying
        their impact on the forefront of technological advancement. This multifaceted approach not only signifies the
        initiative’s dedication to academic excellence but also highlights its success in nurturing a generation of
        research-oriented and inventive mechanical engineers.

    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Recent Grants and Projects:</h4>
    <br>
    <p>In the current year, 3.5 Lakhs grant is sanctioned for an ATAL Faculty Development Program (FDP) focused on
        Advancing Energy Storage: Technology, Integration, and Implementation with collaboration with Electrical
        Engineering Department. The department has active participation in the RGSTC Drone Project as manufacturing
        partners. A dedicated group of faculty members is contributing to the project by working on the manufacturing of
        composite material drone components. Additionally, their expertise extends to the production of composite
        furniture, such as chairs and stools, showcasing the department’s diverse involvement in cutting-edge research
        and practical applications.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Summary and Impact:</h4>
    <br>
    <p>In summary, the Mechanical Engineering Department’s journey has been marked by continuous expansion and
        excellence in both academia and research. Notably, the department has received a substantial total research
        grant of 4 Crores from various funding agencies, underscoring its commitment to advancing the frontiers of
        knowledge. Additionally, the department has leveraged its expertise through consultancy projects, accumulating
        an impressive amount of 11.24 Lakhs. The extensive dissemination of knowledge is reflected in the publication of
        324 research papers in reputable journals and conferences, showcasing the department’s impactful contributions
        to the scholarly community. Furthermore, the approximate lab investment of 3.1 Crores signifies a steadfast
        dedication to providing state-of-the-art infrastructure for practical learning and cutting-edge research. These
        achievements collectively illustrate the Mechanical Engineering Department’s holistic growth, firmly
        establishing itself as a hub for academic excellence, innovation, and research prowess.</p>
